# Handoff: skasm (sketch + assembly), from 2026-10-26

Area (PLAN 2.3): crates/sketch, crates/scene/src/sketch_mode.rs, sketch behaviour in the app (part_studio/sketch.rs),
crates/app/src/assembly_*.rs + assembly_view.rs, crates/model/src/assembly, standard content. Older notes:
docs/handoff/sketch-behaviour.md, docs/handoff/assembly-behaviour.md (skb), checklists docs/parity/sketch.md,
docs/parity/assembly.md.

Setup: worktree /root/projects/noshape-wt/skasm (branch agent/skasm), CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/root/target-skasm, env in
/root/skasm-scratch/env.sh, detached jobs via /root/skasm-scratch/run.sh <log> "<cmd>". GUI: /root/skasm-scratch/ui/
(start.sh, sketch_top.sh, shot.sh, stop.sh; DISPLAY=:103). Live: my own Chrome tab via /root/skasm-scratch/live/r.mjs
(copy of live-pw/r.mjs; tab id in .skasm-tab; CDP connect takes ~35 s under load); scratch Part Studio "skasm poly"
(569dabca19a397e932f2db54) in noshape mm test.

## Landed on main
- cdde1c06 F19 Width mate in any pick order + DOF cache across evaluations, per-group DOF length scale.
- c76cdcf4 assembly least change measured at the bodies' mate connectors (oracle_asm R1 matches live; R1 out of KNOWN;
  R3/C1 now keep rz 0, still KNOWN for live's −157.5°).
- 8016ded6 committed polygon's grey-boxed Ø readout (live colours) until the next polygon.
- e5567eca SKETCH-DRAG-BIG in the app: the DOF analysis once before a drag (Sketch::refresh_analysis): 42–125 → 13–18 ms
  per step on qa's 1000-entity sketch (dev build, load ~40).
- ac0645bc SKETCH-PASTE: the Transform triad on the copy.
- dcd3cd30 oracle_asm R3 / C1 as live: exactly opposed axial connectors turn over about world Z × w (live's constant);
  KNOWN now holds only M1 (live's own over-constrained case).
- c95ed870 closing Animate mate gives the keyboard back (Alt+C search got no typing).
- a239abb0, 782944e5 sketch polygon side count per 10 px, click commits without a next polygon, a tool session starts
  at 6 sides; circle / polygon Ø readout halfway or outside as live.
- b154b333, 507ce0e5, 57cab72a: test of the assembly error texts against live's (assembly sweep rows checked).
- 4ca39911 assembly fuzz test (T2).
- 3bcb5145 SKETCH-DRAG-BIG: sketch regions' hole search by bounding box (regions 38 → 3.5 ms, regen 47 → 12 ms per
  drag step on 1000 entities; perf test scene sketch_perf::big_shape_sketch_drag_step_parts).
- 6329b168 sketch: polygons as live (seed + circular pattern; Inscribed = edge middle, Circumscribed = vertex; no Ø
  dimension), Point tool on the Origin, paste at the pointer + Transform (SKETCH-PASTE), unsolvable constraint keeps
  the shape; API polygon descriptions.

## WIP on agent/skasm
(none: the branch equals main)

## Next, in order
Sketch P1: no open items (parity/sketch.md all ✅; workflow-sketch-tools.md rechecked 10-27). Assembly P2:
1. docs/parity/workflow-assembly-sweep.md still 🔧: 9 / 29 (secondary axis ∥ primary, MC dialog), 11 (Replicate,
   nothing matches), 19 second half ("Missing mate to be matched."), 28 badges' tooltips, 34 (assembly section view
   manipulator, big). GUI on /root/green/noshape with /root/skasm-scratch/qa/asm1.noshape (plate + 2 pins, made by
   /root/skasm-scratch/qa/asm1.py over MCP).
2. docs/parity/assembly.md G5 exploded views (⏳): verify against live 800–826 (workflow-exploded-named-positions.md
   rows 2–15 are from an old pass; recheck them).
3. workflow-mates.md / workflow-assembly.md / workflow-configured-assembly.md: old passes; recheck their ✗ rows on green
   (several are fixed in code, e.g. MT3–MT6).
4. Which part moves when neither is fixed in an exact flip (live's rule open, behaviours R3 note); ours moves the first
   connector's part (as live in 10 of 14 runs).
5. Slot: live shows all 3 offset glyphs at the end cap; after the commit live's centre line is plain dark blue (ours
   stayed highlighted once, not reproduced).
6. Assembly drag bench (psui's, viewport.rs) gives up on llvmpipe ("nothing under the viewport centre": the hover pick
   isn't back within 300 ticks); fine on CI runners presumably.
7. Assembly fuzz (T2) `random_assembly_edits_never_panic`: `ASM_FUZZ_SEEDS=1..200 ASM_FUZZ_STEPS=120 cargo test -p
   noshape-assembly --lib assembly::tests::random_assembly_edits_never_panic -- --ignored --nocapture` (clean 10-27).
8. End-of-day walk, daily (~04:00 UTC): see below.

Walks: 10-27 02:40 on green 19555ca3: line chain + dimension, polygon, V on H toast, mate dialog (types, limits,
errors), Revolute + drag (only the dragged instance moves): no regressions. 04:00 on green 8165fca6: paste (copy at the
pointer, selected, Transform triad on it). Sketch options (Show constraints / expressions / errors) persist in
~/.config/noshape/sketch-options.json, so "Show expressions" can start ticked on this box; not a bug.

Assembly perf (10-27, dev build, `cargo test -p noshape-ops --test all assembly_perf:: -- --ignored --nocapture`):
200 pins / 300 mates: evaluation again 6.5 ms, adding a mate 16.5 ms, inserting a pin 7.8 ms (was ~50), drag steps
1.9–2.8 ms (frame with the scene 2.2–3.1 ms); 1000 free pins: drag 0.55 ms, insert 3.8 ms. All inside the budgets.

## Build times (10-26, load 30–55, 4 agents building)
- First build of app + cli on this target dir: 60 min. First test build of ops tests: 20 min.
- After rebasing on c9540ae6 (workspace-hack, tests/all.rs): `cargo test -p noshape-ops --test all mate_flip::`
  recompiled everything: 955 s.
- 10-27, noshape-assembly crate: edit → `cargo test -p noshape-assembly --lib assembly::tests::<name>` 23–32 s.
- 10-27, layered crates, load ~30: first build after the rebase 254 s (model-core lib tests). Edit in
  model-core/assembly/solver.rs → `cargo test -p noshape-model-core --lib assembly::solver` 108–122 s; →
  `cargo test -p noshape-model --test all oracle_asm::` 113 s. Sketch-crate edit → `cargo test -p noshape-sketch`
  35 s; scene edit → `cargo test -p noshape-scene --lib` 92 s (first after a sketch change). Clippy of model-core +
  model after an edit 53 s. T0 after a sketch/scene edit 830 s total chain (incl. the tests above).
